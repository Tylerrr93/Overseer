# Digitized Overseer

A post-apocalyptic factory automation sandbox set on a ruined Earth. Hand-harvest scarce resource nodes, build extractors, smelt ore, wire up a power grid, and automate production lines — all running in a PixiJS v8 WebGL renderer deployed to GitHub Pages.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # Vite dev server → http://localhost:5173
npm run build      # Production build → /dist  (deploy to GitHub Pages)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
```

## Gameplay

### World
The world is procedurally generated from a seeded noise function. Terrain is post-apocalyptic desolation: blasted ground, rubble fields, exposed bedrock, irradiated craters, and sparse water bodies. Resources do not exist as tiles — they exist as **resource nodes** (features) layered on top of terrain.

### Resource Nodes
Nodes are scattered sparingly across the world using a local-maximum cluster algorithm. Each node has a finite yield and is destroyed when depleted (configurable via `RESOURCE_DEPLETION_ENABLED` in `GameConfig`).

| Node | Yields | Harvest time |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Scrap Deposit | Scrap Metal | 1.8 s (infinite) |
| Iron Vein | Iron Ore | 3.5 s |
| Copper Vein | Copper Ore | 3.2 s |
| Coal Seam | Coal | 2.8 s |

### Manual Harvesting
Stand on a resource node and **hold LMB or Space** to harvest. A progress bar appears above the tile. Stepping off the tile cancels the harvest. Harvesting works even while menus are open.

### Buildings & Machines

| Machine | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Iron Extractor | Place on an iron vein; fuel-powered; drills iron ore |
| Coal Extractor | Place on a coal seam; grid-powered (seed with fuel via F) |
| Basic Smelter | Smelts ore into plates; coal-fired; 2×2 |
| Fabricator | Electric precision assembler; crafts components; 3×3 |
| Carbon Press | Compresses coal into carbon rods; 2×2 |
| Personal Fabricator | Always-available wrist device; slow but no power needed |
| Transport Belt | Moves items along a direction; chainable |
| Power Node | Distributes grid power; connects nodes within 6 tiles, powers machines within 4 |
| Coal Generator | Burns coal to produce 500 W |
| Storage Chest | Large buffer; accepts items from belts on all sides |

### Power Grid
Machines with a `powerDraw > 0` require grid power or fuel to operate. Place **Coal Generators** and connect them via **Power Nodes**. The `⚡` overlay (Alt or the action bar button) shows live network stats: supply, demand, surplus, satisfaction %, and fuel estimates.

### Belts & Logistics
Transport Belts move items one tile per direction. Extractors and machines push items into adjacent belts from their output ports. Belt direction is set when placed; items flow automatically.

### Save System
Progress is auto-saved every 60 seconds. The **⚙ System** menu offers manual save, load, wipe, and JSON export/import. Save version is tracked — mismatched versions are rejected cleanly.

## Architecture

### The Dependency Rule
```
index.html
  └── src/main.ts
        ├── @game/content   (registers content at boot, then done)
        └── @engine/*       (owns the running game)
              └── @t/*      (shared interfaces only — no logic)
```

`@engine` **never** imports `@game`. The `Registry` singleton is the only bridge — content registers definitions at boot, the engine reads them at runtime.

### Key Singletons

| Export | File | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `registry` | `Registry.ts` | Frozen content definitions |
| `sm` | `StateManager.ts` | Mutable `GameState`; the only source of truth |
| `bus` | `EventBus.ts` | Typed pub/sub event channel |

### GameState
Plain JSON-serializable object. Save is `JSON.stringify(sm.state)`. Load is `JSON.parse` + field migrations. Current save version: **3**.

### Resource Node System
Nodes are stored as `Record<"lx,ly", FeatureState>` on each `Chunk`. WorldGen places them via a secondary noise pass with a local-maximum cluster algorithm (controlled by `RESOURCE_SPARSITY` and `RESOURCE_CLUSTER_SIZE`). `ExtractorSystem` reads the same map; `PlayerSystem` writes harvest progress into `PlayerState.harvestProgress` so the `Renderer` can draw the progress bar without any extra coupling.

### UI Scale
All UI sizes are driven by `--ui-scale` on `:root`. `UIStyleManager.applyScale(n)` is the single write point. Scale is persisted to `localStorage` and applied at step 0 of boot (before any panel is constructed) so GitHub Pages and local dev render at a consistent size. The user can adjust it via **⚙ System → Display Scale**.

## Adding New Content

### New Item
`src/game/content/items.ts` — add to the array. No engine changes.

### New Recipe
`src/game/content/recipes.ts` — add to the array. If `machineTag` matches an existing doodad, it works immediately.

### New Resource Node
`src/game/content/features.ts` — add a `FeatureDef`:
```ts
{
  id:            "titanium_deposit",
  name:          "Titanium Deposit",
  sprite:        "#a0c0d8",
  yieldsItemId:  "titanium_ore",
  baseYield:     300,
  extractorTag:  "extractor_titanium",
  harvestTimeMs: 4000,
}
```
WorldGen automatically picks it up via `registry.allFeatures()` — no engine changes.

### New Building
`src/game/content/doodads.ts` — add a `DoodadDef`. The renderer, build system, and doodad system pick it up automatically.
